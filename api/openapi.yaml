  description: "The Kagi API provides programmatic access to data that powers our\
    \ search results & more. \n\nQuick start for all APIs:\n\n- Create an account\
    \ at [Kagi](https://kagi.com/signup)\n- Generate an [API key](https://kagi.com/settings?p=api)\n\
    - Call the API\n\nWe have the following APIs available.\n### Commercial\n\n- Kagi\
    \ Search API (invite only at the moment)\n- Web and News Enrichment API (public,\
    \ exposes Kagi's own indexes Teclis and TinyGem)\n- Universal Summarizer API (public)\n\
    - FastGPT API (public)\n\n### Free\n\n- Kagi Small Web RSS feed (public)\n\n###\
    \ Official Client Libraries\n\nWe offer the following libraries you can use to\
    \ interact with the Kagi API. These are generated from an OpenAPI spec. If you\
    \ have a language you would like to use and it's not in the list, send us a message\
    \ and we will add it to the list if it is supported. Or you can use the [spec](https://wild-wombat.redocly.app/_spec/openapi.yaml?download)\
    \ to build your own custom library.\n\n- [Golang](https://github.com/kagisearch/kagi-api-golang)\n\
    - [Python](https://github.com/kagisearch/kagi-api-python)\n\n### Unofficial Client\
    \ Libraries\n\nThere also exist third party libraries for interacting with the\
    \ Kagi API.\n\n- [kagigo for Go](https://github.com/httpjamesm/kagigo) - FastGPT\
    \ & Universal Summarizer\n- [kagi-api](https://crates.io/crates/kagi-api) for\
    \ Rust\n- [kagi-api](https://alchemists.io/projects/kagi-api) for Ruby\n- [kagi-dotnet](https://github.com/patchoulish/kagi-dotnet)\
    \ for C#/.NET\n\n### API Status\n\nOur existing API, the \"v0\" beta API, is being\
    \ replaced with a new version that will be available publicly soon. As changes\
    \ are made, we will be updating the documentation below when the new features\
    \ become available.\n\nSee the [Support and Community](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/support-and-community/)\
    \ section for details.\n### Pricing\n\nWe are in the process of moving all APIs\
    \ to a post-paid tiered system, where each tier has a limit on the number of requests\
    \ that can be made. If an API has a pricing section, then it is still being migrated\
    \ over to the new billing system.\n\n### GitHub Discussions\n\nThis is the preferred\
    \ venue for bug reports and feature requests.\n\n- [Bug Reports](https://github.com/kagisearch/kagi-docs/issues/new/choose)\n\
    - [Q&A Forum](https://github.com/kagisearch/kagi-docs/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=category%3AQ%26A+label%3Aproduct%3Akagi_search_api)\n\

    The Search API gives programmable access to Kagi's premium search results. It will inherit the settings in your account. For example, you can:

    - Block or promote websites ([results personalization](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/getting-started/index.html))
    - Select to receive longer or shorter search snippets (under [Settings -> Search](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/settings/search.html))

    For a full list, please check out our [search features.](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/features/website-info-personalized-results.html)

    The Universal Summarizer is an API using powerful LLMs to summarize any content, of almost any format, with unlimited token length!
    As an alternative to using the API, we provide the Kagi Search browser extension ([Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kagi-search-for-chrome/cdglnehniifkbagbbombnjghhcihifij?pli=1)/[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/kagi-search-for-firefox/)) and you can use the most advanced Muriel model right from the extension.

    Universal Summarizer API uses pre-paid API credits. You can manage API credits in the API billing page of your Kagi settings.

    Using API with insufficient credits will produce "Insufficient credit to perform this request." response message.
    ### Pricing
    #### Consumer models

    Price for our consumer-grade models (Cecil and Agnes) is $0.030 USD per 1,000 tokens processed. If you are subscribed to the Kagi Ultimate plan, discounted pricing at $0.025 per 1,000 tokens processed is automatically applied.

    Notes:

    - Tokens include all tokens processed in + out.
    - Any request over 10,000 tokens is billed as 10,000 tokens, regardless of the length of the document.
    - Accessing cached summaries of the same URL is always free.

    #### Enterprise models

    Our enterprise-grade Muriel summarization engine produces even higher quality summaries, especially for long documents. It also provides longer and more detailed summaries than our consumer-grade model. See the difference [here](https://blog.kagi.com/universal-summarizer#muriel).

    Muriel usage is a flat rate of $1 USD per summary, regardless of the length or type of the document.

    To use Muriel just use "muriel" as the "engine" parameter in the API call. See examples below.
    ### Privacy

    Read how summarization data is handled in our [privacy policy](https://kagi.com/privacy#Summarizer).

    For handling sensitive information and documents, we recommend setting the 'cache' API parameter to False. In this way, the document will "flow through" our infrastructure and will not be retained anywhere after processing.
    ### Integrations

    Universal Summarizer is available as a [Zapier integration](https://zapier.com/apps/universal-summarizer-by-kagi-ca1/integrations) allowing you to quickly integrate summarization into your programmatic workflows.

    The Enrichment APIs are a collection of indexes that can be used to supplement other products with more novel content from around the web.

    Enrichment APIs allow anyone to get Kagi's unique results, namely the Teclis index (web results) and TinyGem index (news results).

    They are best used for finding non-commercial websites and "small web" discussions surrounding a particular topic. The news enrichment API offers interesting discussions and news worth reading from typically non-mainstream sources.

    They are not "general" search indexes that can answer any type of query, but rather these results are our "secret sauce" and what makes Kagi results unique and interesting and are best used in combination with a general results index.
    ### Pricing

    Since results are niche, we bill only when non-zero results are returned.

    FastGPT is a Kagi service that uses powerful LLMs to answer user queries and runs a full search engine underneath. Think ChatGPT, but on steroids and faster! You can try the web app [here](https://kagi.com/fastgpt).

    ### Pricing

    Pricing for FastGPT is a flat rate per-query:

    1.5¢ per query ($15 USD per 1000 queries).

    The Translate APIs are a collection of endpoints that can be used to translate webpages, documents, and text into different laguages. You can try our amazing [web app here](https://translate.kagi.com/) to get a good idea of what is possible when you don't have to worry about the language of online communication.

          If no language is specified, the document's original language is allowed to influence the summarizer's output. Specifying a language will add an explicit translation step, to translate the summary to the desired language.

          For example, if a document is mostly written in Spanish, the summary output may itself be in Spanish or contain Spanish passages. Specifying "EN" will ensure all passages are translated as English.

Kagi API

The Kagi API provides programmatic access to data that powers our search results & more.   Quick start for all APIs:  - Create an account at [Kagi](https://kagi.com/signup) - Generate an [API key](https://kagi.com/settings?p=api) - Call the API  We have the following APIs available. ### Commercial  - Kagi Search API (invite only at the moment) - Web and News Enrichment API (public, exposes Kagi's own indexes Teclis and TinyGem) - Universal Summarizer API (public) - FastGPT API (public)  ### Free  - Kagi Small Web RSS feed (public)  ### Official Client Libraries  We offer the following libraries you can use to interact with the Kagi API. These are generated from an OpenAPI spec. If you have a language you would like to use and it's not in the list, send us a message and we will add it to the list if it is supported. Or you can use the [spec](https://wild-wombat.redocly.app/_spec/openapi.yaml?download) to build your own custom library.  - [Golang](https://github.com/kagisearch/kagi-api-golang) - [Python](https://github.com/kagisearch/kagi-api-python)  ### Unofficial Client Libraries  There also exist third party libraries for interacting with the Kagi API.  - [kagigo for Go](https://github.com/httpjamesm/kagigo) - FastGPT & Universal Summarizer - [kagi-api](https://crates.io/crates/kagi-api) for Rust - [kagi-api](https://alchemists.io/projects/kagi-api) for Ruby - [kagi-dotnet](https://github.com/patchoulish/kagi-dotnet) for C#/.NET  ### API Status  Our existing API, the \"v0\" beta API, is being replaced with a new version that will be available publicly soon. As changes are made, we will be updating the documentation below when the new features become available.  See the [Support and Community](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/support-and-community/) section for details. ### Pricing  We are in the process of moving all APIs to a post-paid tiered system, where each tier has a limit on the number of requests that can be made. If an API has a pricing section, then it is still being migrated over to the new billing system.  ### GitHub Discussions  This is the preferred venue for bug reports and feature requests.  - [Bug Reports](https://github.com/kagisearch/kagi-docs/issues/new/choose) - [Q&A Forum](https://github.com/kagisearch/kagi-docs/discussions/categories/q-a?discussions_q=category%3AQ%26A+label%3Aproduct%3Akagi_search_api) - [API Feature Requests](https://github.com/kagisearch/kagi-docs/discussions/categories/kagi-search-api-feature-requests-ideas)  ### Discord Join our [Discord](https://kagi.com/discord)! Good for quick questions or chatting about things you've made with our APIs!
